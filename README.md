# Predicting Income Level from US Census Data

In this project I analyze US Census Data and build statistical models in order to predict whether
an individualâ€™s annual income is greater or less than $50,000. The training and test data is from the
UCI (University of California at Irvine) Machine Learning Repository. There are two parts to this
project. In this first part, I explore the data and engineer features in R. In the second part, I fit and
evaluate some predictive models in Python.
